# Campus Scheduler
This project involves the development of an Automatic College Bell System using an Arduino microcontroller. The system automates the ringing of a bell based on pre-set schedules, ensuring precise and consistent operation. It integrates components such as an LCD display, DS1302 RTC module, buzzer, relay, and buttons for user interaction.
### Features
1. Automated Bell Ringing: Rings the bell at pre-set times using a buzzer and relay.
2. Real-Time Clock (RTC): Uses the DS1302 RTC module for accurate timekeeping.
3. User Interface: Includes an LCD display to show time, date, and alarm settings.
4. User Input: Buttons allow users to set, check, and delete alarms.
5. EEPROM Storage: Saves alarm settings to EEPROM for persistence across power cycles.
### How to run
1. Clone this repository using git clone
2. Open the program.ino file in the Arduino IDE
3. Connect the hardware components according to the schematic diagram
4. Upload the code to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE
