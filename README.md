# Campus Scheduler
This project involves the development of an Automatic College Bell System using an Arduino microcontroller. The system automates the ringing of a bell based on pre-set schedules, ensuring precise and consistent operation. It integrates components such as an LCD display, DS1302 RTC module, buzzer, relay, and buttons for user interaction.
### Features
- Automated Bell Ringing: Rings the bell at pre-set times using a buzzer and relay.
- Real-Time Clock (RTC): Uses the DS1302 RTC module for accurate timekeeping.
- User Interface: Includes an LCD display to show time, date, and alarm settings.
- User Input: Buttons allow users to set, check, and delete alarms.
- EEPROM Storage: Saves alarm settings to EEPROM for persistence across power cycles.
### How to run
